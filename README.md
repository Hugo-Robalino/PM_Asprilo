# PM_Asprilo
This is an ongoing project about intra-logistics and warehouse automation. All information can be found in their GitHub pages [asprilo](https://github.com/potassco/asprilo) and [asprilo-encodings](https://github.com/potassco/asprilo-encodings) as well as in the official [website](https://potassco.org/asprilo/).

The main goal of this project is to achieve parallelization of actions taken by robots in a warehouse. In other words, robots can make now two actions per time-step instead of one.

Parallelization of actions is based on this [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370206000774).
